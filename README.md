Render Gatekeeper
-----------------

Gatekeeper is an add-on for blender that allows you to save and reload render settings, and store settings for your final renders that you can then check are as they should be before setting off final renders. It is generally an attempt at a bit of idiot proofing when doing renders. It is currently most likely to be buggy and untested and is only on GitHub because that's a convenient place to keep it. It is provided completely without warranty or even the slightest notion that it might be fit for any purpose whatsoever.


Installation:
-------------
Download the zip folder of this repo and install it from blender's add-on manager.

Usage:
------
Gatekeeper adds a panel to the render tab of the properties window, with some expandable menu's for checking various things you might want to check before rendering, including whether all your layers are turned on, whether your file output nodes are hooked up to anything, and whether you've changed any important render settings.
